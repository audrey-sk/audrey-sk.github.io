            <h2> About me...</h2>
            <p>I'm a problem-solver at heart—whether it's debugging code, capturing <br>the perfect shot, 
                or figuring out the best late-night food spot. As a front-end developer <br>in the making, 
                I love crafting intuitive experiences, but I also have a soft spot for <br> AI, ML, CV and anything
                 that challenges me. <br>
                 Beyond the screen, photography is my creative escape, where I capture <br>
                 fleeting moments that tell a story.<br>
                  When I’m not coding or shooting, I’m probably on a nighttime drive, lost in music, <br>
                  or strategizing my next board game win.<br>
                   Let’s create, innovate, and maybe grab a great meal along the way</p>
